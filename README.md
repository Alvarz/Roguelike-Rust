# **Roguelike Adventure in Rust**  

Embark on an odyssey of coding and creativity with this Roguelike game, crafted as a journey to master both the Rust programming language and the Entity Component System (ECS) paradigm. This project owes its genesis to the exceptional tutorial available at [Roguelike Tutorial - In Rust](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/), which guided its development.  

## **The Premise**  

As an intrepid adventurer, your mission is nothing short of heroic: delve into the perilous depths of the unknown, confront the fearsome demon that threatens the world, claim the legendary Amulet of Yendor, and return triumphantly to your village to secure peace for all.  

## **Known Bugs**  

While the adventure is captivating, a few quirks remain to be vanquished:  
- **Erratic Boss Behavior:** On occasion, bosses display unpredictable movements.  
- **Items in Walls:** It is possible for items to spawn embedded within walls.  
- **Horde Mode Glitch:** Rarely, friendly mobs spawn during Horde mode, causing waves to become stuck until the depth is changed.
